# COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray Images

This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a deep learning model that classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19 positive or negative.

## Reflection

Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of building and training deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. I learned how to handle real-world datasets, preprocess them, and prepare them for use in a neural network. Working with medical imaging data was particularly challenging due to the nuances of data quality and the importance of accurate labeling. Implementing the model required me to refine my skills in designing neural networks, specifically in choosing the right architecture and parameters to effectively learn from the data. Lastly, this project highlighted the critical role of validation in ensuring the model generalizes well beyond the training data.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the necessary libraries and run the script:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   cd your-repository-name
   ```

2. **Set Up a Python Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn pillow requests
   ```

## Usage

To run the script and train the model, simply execute the following command in the root directory of this project:

```bash
python covid_detection.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:
- Download the dataset.
- Process the images.
- Train the model to detect COVID-19.
- Evaluate the model's performance.

## Output

The script will output the model's accuracy and loss metrics on the training and validation dataset. It will also save the trained model to the file `covid_classifier_model.keras` for later use or further evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. You can improve the existing model, add new features, or improve the documentation. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
